# AngularMasterP

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.9.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Everything you need installed to start this project:

Install the latest version of Node.js (Mac or Windows)

Mac users can optionally brew install node if they have brew installed
Node Sass, you may need it if you haven't already got it installed:

npm install -g node-sass

## Installing the project:

Use npm or yarn to install the project's dependencies. (If you do not have yarn installed in your terminal use npm install -g yarn).This provides a package manager.
Now you can run either yarn install or npm install to install the project's dependencies. 

## Running the project:
This project is built using a webpack-dev-server. In this, the webpack-dev-server provides a local development that recompiles our app when a file changes. (The project will automatically refresh the page when changes are made.) 

The command(s) to run a project: npm start or yarn start

Then open your browser to localhost:4200 to start running the code.

## How the webpack server works:
Compile all our TypeScript code into JavaScript (starting from main.ts and branching outwards from imported files)
Bundle all our JavaScript into one file to use
Allow us to use SASS for our component's CSS files
Provide the polyfills needed to run our app in all modern browsers
Mock a JSON backend using json-server
